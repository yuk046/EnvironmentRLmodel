function displayModelEnvironmentDiff(~,~)
% displayModelEnvironmentDiff — no-op stub
%
% This function intentionally does nothing to avoid noisy console output
% and figure creation during batch runs. It preserves the original
% function signature so callers remain compatible.

% If you need debugging output, replace this stub with a logging helper
% that writes to a file (so batch runs remain non-interactive), or
% temporarily re-enable the original implementation during interactive
% debugging.

% No operation performed.
